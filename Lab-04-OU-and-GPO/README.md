# Lab 04 — OU Design and Group Policy Implementation

---

### Overview

In this lab, I implemented Group Policy Objects (GPOs) within the Monroe Redstone Technology Group (MRTG) environment to enforce centralized security configurations across domain-joined systems.

This lab demonstrates how identity-driven policy enforcement is used to control user and device behavior, a critical component of Identity and Access Management (IAM) in enterprise and government environments.

## Objective

- Deploy and configure Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- Enforce security controls on domain-joined endpoints
- Validate policy application using gpresult
- Understand how Group Policy supports IAM governance and compliance
