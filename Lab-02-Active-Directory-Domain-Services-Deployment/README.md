## Overview
Monroe Redstone Technology Group (MRTG) deployed a centralized identity infrastructure using Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to support authentication, access control, and identity management.

This lab establishes a domain controller for the internal domain `mrtg.local`, forming the foundation for enterprise identity and access management.

---

## Objective
Deploy and configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to establish a centralized identity authority.

This includes:
- Installing AD DS
- Promoting a domain controller
- Configuring DNS
- Validating authentication and name resolution

---

## Scope

### Included
- Windows Server 2022 deployment (Hyper-V)
- Server configuration and initial hardening
- Static IP assignment
- AD DS installation and domain controller promotion
- DNS configuration (AD-integrated zones)
- Authentication and DNS validation
- Hyper-V checkpoint creation

### Not Included
- Organizational Unit (OU) design
- User and group provisioning
- Group Policy Object (GPO) configuration
- Domain-joined workstation setup

---

## Environment

| Component | Value |
|----------|------|
| Host OS | Windows 11 Pro |
| Hypervisor | Hyper-V |
| VM Name | MRTG-DC01 |
| OS | Windows Server 2022 Standard (Desktop Experience) |
| Generation | Gen 2 |
| Memory | 8 GB |
| Disk | 80 GB |
| Network | Hyper-V Virtual Switch |
| IP Address | 192.168.10.10 |
| Role | Domain Controller |
| Domain | mrtg.local |

---
## Architecture

The MRTG-DC01 server functions as the primary domain controller within the `mrtg.local` domain, hosting:

- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Active Directory-integrated DNS

This system serves as the centralized identity provider, responsible for:

- Authentication (Kerberos)
- Authorization and access control
- Directory object management
- Service discovery via DNS

This architecture establishes the foundation for identity and access management (IAM) within the enterprise environment.

## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1 — AD DS Installation
![AD DS Role Installation](./screenshots/01-ad-ds-role-installation.png)

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role installed using Server Manager.

---

### Phase 2 — Prerequisite Validation
![Prerequisites Check](./screenshots/02-ad-ds-prerequisites-check.png)

Prerequisite checks completed successfully prior to domain controller promotion.

---

### Phase 3 — Forest & Domain Creation
![New Forest Creation](./screenshots/03-new-forest-mrtg-local.png)

A new Active Directory forest was created with the root domain `mrtg.local`.

---

### Phase 4 — DNS Configuration
![DNS Zones](./screenshots/04-dns-zones-mrtg-local.png)

AD-integrated DNS zones were automatically created during promotion.

![MSDCS Records](./screenshots/05-dns-msdcs-service-records.png)

Critical `_msdcs` service records confirm proper domain controller registration.

![DNS Records](./screenshots/06-dns-host-and-service-record.png)

Host and service records validated within DNS.

---

### Phase 5 — Network Configuration Validation
![IP Configuration](./screenshots/07-ipconfig-domain-controller.png)

Static IP configuration verified with DNS pointing to the domain controller.

---

### Phase 6 — Authentication & Name Resolution Validation
![Authentication Validation](./screenshots/08-domain-authentication-validation.png)

Successful authentication and DNS resolution confirmed:
- Domain context verified (`whoami`)
- Domain name resolves correctly (`ping mrtg.local`)

---

### Phase 7 — Infrastructure Baseline Checkpoint
![Checkpoint](./screenshots/09-post-dc-promotion-checkpoint.png)

A Hyper-V checkpoint was created to preserve a stable domain controller baseline.
---

## Outcome

- Successfully deployed AD DS domain (`mrtg.local`)
- Established MRTG-DC01 as domain controller
- Configured AD-integrated DNS
- Validated authentication and name resolution
- Created a reusable infrastructure baseline
- Established a functional identity infrastructure aligned with enterprise IAM principles

This environment serves as the identity foundation for future IAM labs.
