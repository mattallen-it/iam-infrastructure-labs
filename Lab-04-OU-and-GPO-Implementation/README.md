# Lab 04 — Organizational Unit (OU) Design and Group Policy

---

## Overview

In this lab, I implemented Group Policy Objects (GPOs) within the Monroe Redstone Technology Group (MRTG) environment to enforce centralized security configurations across domain-joined systems.

This lab demonstrates how identity-driven policy enforcement is used to control user and device behavior, a critical component of Identity and Access Management (IAM) in enterprise and government environments.

The approach aligns with enterprise security frameworks by ensuring consistent, auditable control over user sessions and endpoint configurations.

## Objective

- Deploy and configure Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- Enforce security controls on domain-joined endpoints
- Validate policy application using `gpresult`
- Understand how Group Policy supports IAM governance and compliance

- Finance
- Operations
- Engineering
- Executives

## Lab Steps and Evidence

### 1. Created Top-Level OU Structure
A structured OU hierarchy was created to separate users, groups, computers, and privileged accounts, aligning with enterprise identity management practices.

---

### 2. Implemented Departmental OU Segmentation
Department-based OUs were created to logically group users and enable targeted policy application.

---

### 3. Configured Computer OU Segmentation
Workstations and servers were separated into dedicated OUs to support device-based policy enforcement.

---

### 4. Verified Client Placement in Workstations OU
The domain-joined client (CLIENT01) was placed into the Workstations OU to ensure correct GPO targeting.

---

### 5. Created Department-Based Security Groups
Security groups were created for each department to support role-based access control (RBAC).

---

### 6. Implemented Admin Account Separation
Dedicated administrative accounts were created to enforce privilege separation and reduce risk.

---

### 7. Configured Service Accounts
Service accounts were created for application and operational use, following enterprise identity practices.

---

### 8. Created and Linked Workstation GPO
A baseline GPO was created and linked to the Workstations OU to enforce standardized security configurations.

---

### 9. Configured Password Policy
Password complexity, length, and history settings were configured to align with security standards.

---

### 10. Configured Account Lockout Policy
Account lockout thresholds were implemented to protect against brute-force attacks.

---

### 11. Verified GPO Scope and Security Filtering
GPO scope and filtering were validated to ensure correct targeting of users and devices.

---

### 12. Forced Group Policy Update and Verified Computer Policy
Group Policy was updated and validated using gpresult to confirm computer-level policy application.

---

### 13. Verified User Policy Application
User-level policies were validated to confirm identity-based enforcement.

### 14. Simulated Access Denied Scenario (RDP)
A failed remote login attempt demonstrated lack of proper group membership.

---

### 15. Implemented Group-Based Access Control
User access was granted by adding the user to the Remote Desktop Users security group.

---

### 16. Applied Policy Update and Remediation
Group membership changes were applied and policies refreshed to enforce access.

### 17. Final Policy Validation
Final validation confirmed that both computer and user policies were successfully applied.

## Security & IAM Considerations

### Identity-Based Policy Enforcement
- Group Policy applied through Organizational Units (OUs) to enforce centralized control over users and devices
- Separation of users, computers, and administrative accounts reduces risk and improves manageability

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented using security groups
- Access to Remote Desktop was restricted and granted through group membership

### Least Privilege
- Standard user accounts used for daily operations
- Administrative accounts separated to limit privilege escalation risk

### Audit and Validation
- Policy enforcement verified using `gpresult`
- Visibility into applied and filtered policies ensures accountability and compliance

---

## Outcome

- Successfully deployed and linked Group Policy Objects
- Enforced security configurations on domain-joined systems
- Implemented identity-based access control using security groups
- Validated policy enforcement using `gpresult`
- Demonstrated troubleshooting and remediation of access issues

---

## Why This Matters

Organizational Unit (OU) design and Group Policy enforcement form the foundation of identity-driven security in enterprise environments.

By structuring identities through OUs and applying policies centrally, organizations can enforce consistent security controls, reduce administrative overhead, and minimize the risk of misconfigured systems.

This model supports key IAM principles such as least privilege, role-based access control (RBAC), and centralized governance.

In government and enterprise environments, Group Policy is a critical mechanism for enforcing security baselines, controlling user behavior, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
