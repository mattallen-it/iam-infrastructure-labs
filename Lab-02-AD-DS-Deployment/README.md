## Overview

This lab establishes Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) within the MRTG environment by promoting Windows Server 2022 to a Domain Controller.

This deployment creates the centralized identity authority responsible for authentication, authorization, and directory-based access control.

---

## Why This Matters

Active Directory functions as the core identity provider in most enterprise and government environments.

Proper AD DS deployment enables:

- Centralized Kerberos-based authentication  
- Structured identity management through domain hierarchy  
- Secure access control across systems and resources  
- Policy enforcement via Group Policy Objects (GPO)  
- Audit-ready identity infrastructure  

This lab establishes the identity authority that all future access control and governance mechanisms depend on.

## Environment

| Component        | Value |
|-----------------|--------|
| Domain Name      | mrtg.local |
| Domain Controller| MRTG-DC01 |
| OS               | Windows Server 2022 |
| Role Installed   | Active Directory Domain Services |
| Virtualization   | Hyper-V |

---

## Architecture

### Domain Controller — MRTG-DC01
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)  
- DNS Server  

### Directory Structure
- New forest: **mrtg.local**

### Authentication Model
- Kerberos-based domain authentication  

This deployment establishes the centralized identity authority for the MRTG environment.

---

## Security Considerations

- Domain Controller deployed within isolated internal virtual network  
- AD DS installed using least privilege administrative access  
- DNS integrated with Active Directory for secure name resolution  
- Environment prepared for policy enforcement and auditing  

---

## Implementation & Validation

### 1. AD DS Role Installation

### 6. Host and Service Record Validation

---

### 7. Network Configuration Validation
- Static IP configured  
- DNS pointed to self for authoritative resolution

---

### 8. Post-Deployment Checkpoint Creation
A Hyper-V checkpoint was created to preserve the post-promotion state for controlled rollback and testing.

## Outcome

A fully functional Active Directory Domain Services environment was successfully deployed.

- MRTG-DC01 configured as Domain Controller  
- DNS integrated with Active Directory  
- Kerberos-based authentication operational  
- Centralized identity infrastructure established  

The environment now functions as the authoritative identity boundary for domain-joined systems.

## Next Lab

[Lab-03 — Domain Controller Promotion & Identity Structure](../Lab-03-Domain-Controller-Promotion/)

The next lab will cover:

- Organizational Unit (OU) structure design  
- Initial Group Policy configuration  
- Security group implementation (RBAC foundation)  
- Identity organization aligned to business roles
