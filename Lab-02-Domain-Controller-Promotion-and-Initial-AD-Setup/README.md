Monroe Redstone Technology Group is deploying centralized identity infrastructure to support enterprise authentication, access control, and workstation management.

To support this requirement, the organization is deploying an Active Directory domain controller for the internal domain:

mrtg.local

## Objective
Install Windows Server 2022 in Hyper-V, configure the server baseline, and promote the system to a Domain Controller hosting the initial Active Directory environment.

---

# Scope

## Included
- Windows Server 2022 installation in Hyper-V
- Initial server login and baseline configuration
- Hostname change to DC01
- Static IPv4 configuration
- Hyper-V checkpoint creation
- Active Directory Domain Services installation
- Domain Controller promotion
- DNS validation
- Logon server verification

## Not Included
- Organizational Unit design
- User and group provisioning
- Client domain join
- Group Policy creation

# Steps

## 1. Launch Windows Server installer

The virtual machine booted successfully from the Windows Server 2022 ISO image.

---

## 2. Select Windows Server edition

The Desktop Experience edition was selected to support graphical administration tools.

---

## 3. Select Desktop Experience

Desktop Experience allows use of Server Manager, AD tools, and easier documentation.

---

## 4. Select installation disk

Windows Server was installed to the attached 80GB virtual disk.

---

## 5. Initial login and Server Manager verification

After installation, Server Manager automatically launched confirming the OS installed successfully.

---

## 6. Rename server to DC01

The default hostname was changed to **DC01** to follow common infrastructure naming conventions.

---

## 7. Configure static IP address

A static IP was configured to ensure the Domain Controller maintains a consistent network identity.

IP Address  
`192.168.10.10`

Subnet Mask  
`255.255.255.0`

DNS Server  
`192.168.10.10`

![Static IP](images/lab-02-07-static-ip-configuration.png)

---

## 8. Verify server configuration

Server Manager confirmed the hostname and network configuration.

---

## 9. Create pre-Active Directory checkpoint

A Hyper-V checkpoint was created before installing Active Directory to allow easy rollback if needed.

---

## 10. Select role-based installation

The **Add Roles and Features Wizard** was launched using the role-based installation option.

![Role Based Install](images/lab-02-10-role-based-installation-selected.png)

---

## 11. Confirm destination server

The Active Directory Domain Services role was installed on **DC01**.

---

## 12. Select Active Directory Domain Services

The **AD DS role** was selected to install the identity service.

---

## 13. Install AD DS role

The role installation completed successfully.

---

## 14. Start Domain Controller promotion

After installation, the server was promoted to a Domain Controller.

---

## 15. Create a new Active Directory forest

A new forest was created for the lab environment.

---

## 16. Configure domain name

The root domain was set to:

lab.local


![Domain Name](images/lab-02-16-domain-name-lab-local.png)

---

## 17. Validate prerequisites

All prerequisite checks passed before promotion.

![Prerequisites](images/lab-02-17-ad-ds-prerequisites-check-passed.png)

---

## 18. Verify DNS zone creation

After promotion, DNS zones were automatically created.

---

## 19. Verify DC host record

The Domain Controller registered itself in DNS.

dc01.lab.local
192.168.10.10


![DNS Record](images/lab-02-19-dns-host-record-dc01.png)

---

## 20. Verify logon server

The command below confirms authentication against the Domain Controller.

echo %logonserver%

# Lab-02 — Domain Controller Baseline

## Output

---

## 21. Create Post-Promotion Checkpoint

A new Hyper-V checkpoint was created to serve as the **baseline state for future labs**.

---

## Outcome

At the end of this lab:

- Windows Server 2022 was successfully deployed
- The server was renamed to **DC01**
- A **static IP address** was configured
- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** was installed
- A new forest **lab.local** was created
- DNS zones were automatically configured
- The server now functions as the **Domain Controller**

This environment now serves as the **identity infrastructure foundation** for future IAM labs.

---

## Next Lab

**Lab-03 — Active Directory Identity Management**

The next lab will expand the AD environment by introducing:

- Organizational Units (OU structure)
- User account creation
- Security groups
- Domain-joined client workstation
- Basic identity and access management workflows
