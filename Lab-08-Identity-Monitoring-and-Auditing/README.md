## Overview

In this lab, I implemented identity-focused auditing in the **Monroe Redstone Technology Group (MRTG)** Active Directory environment. The objective was to improve visibility into administrative identity activity by configuring domain controller audit policy, applying object-level auditing to the `_MRTG/Users` OU, and validating that delegated administrative actions generated the expected security events.

This lab builds directly on the delegated administration model established in **Lab-07**. Instead of relying on broad administrative access for user-management tasks, I used the delegated admin account **`john.smith.admin`** to perform controlled identity actions and then verified those actions through the domain controller's **Security** log.

- Configure advanced audit policy for:
  - Logon events
  - User account management
  - Directory service changes
  - Security group management
- Verify policy application with `gpupdate` and `auditpol`
- Apply object-level auditing to the `_MRTG/Users` OU
- Generate auditable delegated identity actions
- Validate resulting events in **Event Viewer**

## Lab Environment

### Systems
- **Domain Controller:** `MRTG-DC01`
- **Domain:** `mrtg.local`

### Active Directory Structure
- **Parent OU:** `_MRTG`
- **User OU:** `_MRTG/Users`
- **Admin Accounts OU:** `_MRTG/Admin Accounts`

### Key Accounts and Groups
- **Delegated admin account:** `john.smith.admin`
- **Delegated admin group:** `GG_IT_HelpDesk_Admins`
- **Validation target user:** `Kevin Carter`

### GPOs Used
- **Auditing GPO:** `MRTG-DC-Identity-Auditing`

### Validation Note
A temporary logon-validation configuration was used during lab preparation so the delegated admin account could sign in and perform the scoped identity actions required for testing. The core focus of this lab remained the auditing configuration and resulting event visibility.

### Assumptions
- The delegated administration model from **Lab-07** was already in place
- `john.smith.admin` had validated delegated access to manage users in `_MRTG/Users`
- The environment was running in Hyper-V with checkpoint support

---

## Architecture

This lab used a single-domain Active Directory environment with:

- audit policy configured at the **Domain Controllers** OU level
- object-level auditing applied to the `_MRTG/Users` OU
- delegated user-management activity performed by **`john.smith.admin`**
- event validation performed on **MRTG-DC01**

### High-Level Flow

1. Create and link a dedicated domain controller auditing GPO
2. Configure identity-related advanced audit policy settings
3. Apply object-level auditing to `_MRTG/Users`
4. Perform delegated identity actions
5. Validate resulting security events in Event Viewer

---

## Technologies Used

- Windows Server 2022
- Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
- Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
- Event Viewer
- `gpupdate`
- `auditpol`
- Hyper-V

---

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Created a Pre-Lab Checkpoint

Before making changes, I created a Hyper-V checkpoint to preserve the clean post-Lab-07 environment.

---

### 2. Confirmed Delegated Administration Baseline

I verified that **`john.smith.admin`** remained a member of **`GG_IT_HelpDesk_Admins`** and confirmed the `_MRTG/Users` OU structure was present. This ensured the lab started from the intended delegated-access baseline rather than broad administrative access.

![Lab-08-02 - Delegated Admin Baseline](images/Lab-08-02-Delegated-Admin-Baseline.png)

---

### 3. Created and Linked the Auditing GPO

I created a dedicated GPO named **`MRTG-DC-Identity-Auditing`** and linked it to the **Domain Controllers** OU. I used a dedicated GPO rather than modifying the default policy so the change would remain easier to manage, explain, and validate.

![Lab-08-03 - Auditing GPO Created](images/Lab-08-03-Auditing-GPO-Created.png)

---

### 4. Configured Audit Logon

I enabled **Audit Logon** for both **Success** and **Failure** events. This provides visibility into successful and failed authentication activity on the domain controller.

![Lab-08-04 - Audit Logon Configured](images/Lab-08-04-Audit-Logon-Configured.png)

---

### 5. Configured Audit User Account Management

I enabled **Audit User Account Management** for both **Success** and **Failure** events. This supports monitoring of actions such as password resets and account changes.

![Lab-08-05 - Audit User Account Management Configured](images/Lab-08-05-Audit-User-Account-Management-Configured.png)

---

### 6. Configured Audit Directory Service Changes

I enabled **Audit Directory Service Changes** for **Success** events. This supports tracking of Active Directory object modifications when paired with the appropriate object-level auditing entry.

![Lab-08-06 - Audit Directory Service Changes Configured](images/Lab-08-06-Audit-Directory-Service-Changes-Configured.png)

---

### 7. Configured Audit Security Group Management

I enabled **Audit Security Group Management** for both **Success** and **Failure** events to improve visibility into changes affecting access-control groups.

![Lab-08-07 - Audit Security Group Management Configured](images/Lab-08-07-Audit-Security-Group-Management-Configured.png)

---

### 8. Applied and Verified Audit Policy

I applied the updated policy and verified the resulting configuration with:

```cmd
gpupdate /force
auditpol /get /category:*
```

The output confirmed that the required audit subcategories were enabled, including:

- Logon
- Security Group Management
- User Account Management
- Directory Service Changes

This validated that the domain controller was prepared to capture the identity-related events required for the lab.

---

### 9. Opened the Users OU Auditing Configuration

In Active Directory Users and Computers, I enabled **Advanced Features**, opened the security settings for the `_MRTG/Users` OU, and moved into the **Auditing** section.

This prepared the OU for object-level auditing so changes to descendant user objects could be captured instead of relying only on policy configured at the domain controller level.

![Lab-08-09 - Users OU Auditing Tab](images/Lab-08-09-Users-OU-Auditing-Tab.png)

---

### 10. Added an Auditing Entry for Descendant User Objects

I created a new auditing entry for **Everyone**, set the audit type to **Success**, and scoped it to **Descendant User objects**. I selected change-related permissions so the environment would capture meaningful identity modifications instead of passive directory reads.

This step was critical because enabling **Audit Directory Service Changes** alone is not enough. The target OU also needs an auditing entry so object-level changes generate the expected security events.

- **Principal:** `Everyone`
- **Type:** `Success`
- **Applies to:** `Descendant User objects`

I scoped the entry toward change activity rather than passive read activity. This step was critical because enabling directory service change auditing alone is not enough. The relevant OU or object must also have an auditing entry configured to generate object-modification events.

---

### 11. Performed a Delegated Password Reset

Using the delegated admin account **`john.smith.admin`**, I reset the password for **Kevin Carter** and selected **User must change password at next logon**.

This validated that delegated administrative activity was being performed through the intended scoped identity rather than a broad domain-wide administrative account.

![Lab-08-11 - Password Reset Action](images/Lab-08-11-Password-Reset-Action.png)

---

### 12. Performed a Delegated User Attribute Change

Still using **`john.smith.admin`**, I modified the **Description** field for **Kevin Carter** to:

`Lab 08 audit validation change`

This provided a second controlled identity action for audit validation and helped confirm that both account-management and object-modification events were being logged as expected.

![Lab-08-12 - User Attribute Change](images/Lab-08-12-User-Attribute-Change.png)

---

### 13. Validated Event ID 4724 - Password Reset Attempt

After the delegated password reset, I reviewed the **Security** log in **Event Viewer** on **MRTG-DC01** and confirmed **Event ID 4724**.

This event showed that an attempt was made to reset an account password, which aligned with the delegated password reset performed during the lab.

![Lab-08-13 - Event 4724 Password Reset](images/Lab-08-13-Event-4724-Password-Reset.png)

---

### 14. Validated Event ID 4738 - User Account Changed

I then confirmed **Event ID 4738**, which records that a user account was changed.

This event aligned with the attribute modification performed against the Kevin Carter account and validated that the delegated administrative change was logged correctly.

![Lab-08-14 - Event 4738 User Changed](images/Lab-08-14-Event-4738-User-Changed.png)

---

### 15. Validated Event ID 5136 - Directory Service Object Modified

I confirmed **Event ID 5136** in the **Security** log, which indicates that a directory service object was modified.

This was the key proof that object-level auditing on the `_MRTG/Users` OU was working as intended and that directory changes to descendant user objects were being captured.

![Lab-08-15 - Event 5136 Directory Object Modified](images/Lab-08-15-Event-5136-Directory-Object-Modified.png)

---

### 16. Validated Event ID 4719 - System Audit Policy Changed

Finally, I confirmed **Event ID 4719**, which indicates that the system audit policy was changed.

This validated that audit policy configuration activity itself was also being logged, adding another layer of visibility and accountability to the environment.

![Lab-08-16 - Event 4719 Audit Policy Changed](images/Lab-08-16-Event-4719-Audit-Policy-Changed.png)

---

## Validation / Verification

After the delegated actions were completed, I reviewed the **Security** log in **Event Viewer** on **MRTG-DC01** and confirmed the expected identity-related events.

- **Event ID 4724** - Password reset attempt  
  Confirmed that an attempt was made to reset the target account password.

- **Event ID 4738** - User account changed  
  Confirmed that the user object was modified.

- **Event ID 5136** - Directory service object modified  
  Confirmed that the Active Directory object change was captured through directory service auditing.

- **Event ID 4719** - System audit policy changed  
  Confirmed that audit policy configuration changes were also logged.

## Security Relevance

This lab strengthened the environment by making identity activity visible, traceable, and reviewable.

Key security benefits included:

- improved auditability of delegated identity actions
- better visibility into password resets and user-object changes
- stronger change tracking for Active Directory objects
- improved administrative accountability
- reinforcement of least privilege by separating delegated user actions from broader audit-policy administration

This is directly relevant to IAM operations, directory administration, helpdesk delegation, and regulated IT environments where identity changes must be monitored and validated.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Group Policy Management
- Advanced Audit Policy Configuration
- Active Directory Users and Computers
- Object-level auditing in Active Directory
- Delegated administration validation
- Password reset workflows
- User attribute administration
- Event Viewer log analysis
- Security event validation
- Identity monitoring fundamentals

---

## Outcome

By the end of this lab, I had successfully:

- deployed a dedicated identity-auditing GPO to domain controllers
- verified advanced audit policy settings on the domain controller
- applied object-level auditing to the `_MRTG/Users` OU
- performed delegated identity actions using `john.smith.admin`
- confirmed those actions generated the expected security events in Event Viewer

This lab moved the MRTG environment beyond basic user administration and into auditable identity operations, which is a core control in enterprise IAM and security-focused IT environments.

---

## Next Lab

**Lab-09** will build on this auditing foundation by extending identity control, visibility, or governance deeper into the MRTG environment.
