## Organization

This repository documents a simulated enterprise Identity and Access Management environment for:

**Monroe Redstone Technology Group (MRTG)**

The lab environment models a small-to-mid enterprise identity infrastructure including:

- Windows Server Active Directory
- Domain-joined workstations
- Identity lifecycle management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Group Policy security baselines
- Privileged access administration
- Hybrid identity integration with Microsoft Entra ID
- Identity monitoring and auditing

## Identity Architecture

Identity authentication and authorization are enforced through a centralized Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) model, utilizing domain-joined systems, Kerberos-based authentication, and role-based access control (RBAC) via security groups.

Access to resources is governed through:
- Organizational Unit (OU) structure for policy scoping
- Group Policy Objects (GPO) for configuration enforcement
- Security groups for role-based access assignments

This model aligns with enterprise IAM principles of least privilege, centralized identity control, and auditability.
