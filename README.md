This project simulates a structured enterprise Identity and Access Management (IAM) environment for Monroe Redstone Technology Group (MRTG).

The lab series demonstrates how identity infrastructure is deployed, governed, and secured using Active Directory, with emphasis on policy enforcement, role-based access control (RBAC), and auditability within regulated environments.

Core implementation areas:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Organizational Unit (OU) design
- Group Policy enforcement
- Access control via security groups
- Identity lifecycle governance
- Monitoring and auditing

The focus is on practical IAM operations aligned with enterprise and government environments, emphasizing least privilege, centralized access control, and auditability.

---

## Objectives

- Design, implement, and secure an enterprise identity environment  
- Deploy Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)  
- Enforce identity-based access control  
- Validate policy enforcement across domain systems  
- Align identity operations with governance-oriented IT practices  

---

## Organization

This repository represents a structured IAM implementation for:

**Monroe Redstone Technology Group (MRTG)**

Core identity components include:

- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)  
- Domain-joined endpoints  
- Organizational Unit (OU) hierarchy  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Group Policy-based security enforcement  
- Hybrid identity preparation (future Entra ID integration)  
- Identity monitoring and validation  

---

## Domain

- **Domain Name:** mrtg.local  
- **Directory Services:** Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)  
- **Authentication Model:** Kerberos-based domain authentication  

---

## Systems

### MRTG-DC01 — Domain Controller
- Active Directory  
- DNS  
- Group Policy Management  

### CLIENT01 — Domain-Joined Workstation
- Policy enforcement validation  
- Authentication testing  
- Access control validation

## Infrastructure Architecture

| Component        | Description                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Hypervisor       | Hyper-V (Windows 11 Pro Host)   |
| Domain Controller| MRTG-DC01 — Windows Server 2022 |
| Services         | AD DS, DNS, Group Policy        |
| Client System    | CLIENT01 — Windows 11 Enterprise|

---

## Identity Architecture

Authentication and authorization are centralized through Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).

Access control is enforced through:

- Organizational Unit (OU) structure for policy scoping  
- Group Policy Objects (GPO) for configuration enforcement  
- Security groups for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  

This architecture supports:

- Least privilege  
- Centralized identity governance  
- Policy-driven enforcement  
- Auditability
